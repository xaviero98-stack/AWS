# AWS
In this repository I some examples of the arquitectures deployed while coursing the Industry Quest Financial Services Badge on AWS Skill Builder. Even though this badge is related to the financial sector, you will find its solutions are easily transferable to many generic needs AWS covers. In fact, I chose this Badge because it is the largest one and introduces the uses the most services.

- Each solution is inside one of the folder with a descriptive name in it. Inside every folder there's a schema of the arquitecture with the AWS services it uses and snapshots of each step named with the timestamp they where created on so they are sorted inside the folder on a descending order. You will also find core code and documents which are relevant for the understanding or integration of AWS services inside each corresponding arquitecture folder.

- You will notice that not all the arquitectures are deployed from scratch. Therefore, sometimes first screenshots show services already running or deployed. It's normal, the lab makes you build more components on top of them.
